This project presents a sleep quality detector system utilizing an Arduino microcontroller, a pulse oximeter, and an accelerometer. The system aims to provide an affordable and non-invasive method for monitoring sleep quality by tracking heart rate and body motion. Data is collected and analyzed to determine total sleep time, periods of motion, and overall sleep quality. Results are transmitted to a smartphone application via a Bluetooth module for user-friendly display. Experimental results demonstrate the systemâ€™s capability in accurately detecting sleep patterns and providing meaningful insights into sleep quality.
